  <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)"target="_blank">In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices,</strong><a>
  <p> called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services",
  <br> such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.
  <br> A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[1] Typical servers are database servers, file servers,
  <br> mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

  <br>Client–server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as "server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but alternatively, large <br>computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.
