    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"target="_blank">Unix (/ˈjuːnɪks/; trademarked as UNIX</strong>)<a>
    <br> is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix,
    <br>whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.[3]
    <p><img src="C:\Users\TT00142\unix_logo.jpg">

    <br>Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California, Berkeley (BSD),
    <br>Microsoft (Xenix), Sun Microsystems (SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX), and IBM (AIX). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995.[4] The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group,
    <br>an industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
    <br>However, Novell continues to own the Unix copyrights, which the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc. court case (2010) confirmed.
    <p>
  <br>  Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy".
    <br>According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function.[5] A unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism known as "pipes" serve as the main means of communication,
    <br>and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.
    <p>
    <br>Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.
